# Netflix-dataset
In this project, I will be showcasing data visualizations using a dataset that represents a sample Netflix userbase. The dataset includes details such as user subscription types (Basic, Standard, Premium), monthly revenue, join date, last payment date, and country of residence. Additionally, it features user behavior data, including device types (Smart TV, Mobile, Desktop, Tablet) and account status (active or inactive). These visualizations will offer insights into user trends, preferences, and revenue generation, providing a comprehensive look at this synthetic Netflix dataset.
